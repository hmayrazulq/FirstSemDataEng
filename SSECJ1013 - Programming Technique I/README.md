## Overview
In this course, I learn the basics and a deep dive into coding using VS Code. with the help and assistance of Dr. Luqman, and my friends,
I figure out how to properly program and create a proper .cpp file that is able to be executed. We learn deeply about object-oriented
programming or more specifically, C++ which is know to be used widely in industries, besides python, java, etc.
