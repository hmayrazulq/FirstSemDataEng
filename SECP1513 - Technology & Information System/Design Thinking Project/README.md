# 💡 Design Thinking Project  
**Project Theme:** Student Engagement & Wellness Analytics

This project applies the design thinking approach to address issues related to student engagement and wellness in university life. The goal was to explore how data and simple analytics can be used to better understand students’ academic engagement and overall well-being.

---

## 🎯 Problem Focus

University students often experience challenges related to motivation, stress, workload, and engagement. However, these issues are not always visible or systematically analyzed. Our project focuses on how a student engagement and wellness analytics system could help identify patterns and support better interventions.

## 🧠 Design Thinking Process

### 1️⃣ Empathize  
We conducted interviews with **4 university students**:
- 1 student from the **Faculty of Computing**
- 3 students from the **Faculty of Chemical & Energy Engineering**

Through these interviews, we gathered insights into:
- Academic stress and workload
- Engagement with courses
- Awareness of personal well-being
- Gaps in existing student support systems

---

### 2️⃣ Define  
Based on the interviews, we identified common pain points related to:
- Lack of awareness of personal engagement levels
- Difficulty tracking academic and wellness patterns
- Limited data-driven feedback for students

---

### 3️⃣ Ideate  
We brainstormed features for a system that could:
- Track engagement and wellness indicators
- Provide simple analytics and visual feedback
- Help students reflect on their academic habits

---

### 4️⃣ Prototype (Low-Fidelity)
We created a **low-fidelity prototype** using:
- **Canva** for UI layout design  
- **Hand sketches** to visualize and refine the interface with digital design
- App interface called "UniWell"

The prototype focuses on clarity and usability rather than technical implementation.

### 5️⃣ Testing
We tested our prototype with a university student from the **Faculty of Computing**

From the testing phase, we observed:
- Student reaction towards visualized personal wellness and engagement data
- Clear features (Student Pulse, Attendance Monitoring, Mood Calendar, Early Warning Feature, Assignment Progress Tracking, Weekly Report\0
- Features that need refinement (Clearer UI)

## Prototype Details: 🌱 UniWell
UniWell is a student wellbeing and wellness analytics prototype designed to help university students monitor their academic engagement, wellbeing, and social participation in one integrated platform.

### 🔐 Entrance Page
- Minimal landing screen with a start/play button to enter the app
- Displays application name and tagline “Your University Wellness Companion”

### 🏠 Main Dashboard
- Centralised overview of student wellbeing and engagement
- Emoji-based mood input for daily or weekly check-ins
- Navigation shortcuts to core feature modules
- Donut chart summarizing overall engagement level (e.g. good, moderate, low) for the current week

### 😊 Mood Tracking & Mood Calendar
- Daily mood logging using emoji selection
- Calendar view showing submitted moods across days
- Empty dates indicate missed mood entries
- “Mood Booster” section that recommends wellbeing resources (e.g. podcasts, activities)
- Displays participation count and usefulness percentage for recommended resources

### 📊 Attendance Tracking (Digital Footprint)
- Attendance visualised using calendar layouts
- Conceptual integration with university learning systems (e.g. UTMSMART, eLearning)
- Daily and subject-level attendance summaries

### ❤️ Student Pulse
- Conceptual heart rate measurement by placing index finger on rear camera
- Displays minimum, average, and maximum BPM values
- Historical pulse trends visualised using line charts
- Intended for wellbeing awareness, not medical diagnosis

### 😓 Stress Level Monitoring
- Aggregated stress status visualised using bar indicators
- Displays average heart rate variability (HRV) and pulse rate
- Generates personalised stress descriptions based on detected levels

### 🤝 Social Engagement Tracking
- Overall engagement level displayed using donut charts
- Tracks participation in events, programmes, clubs, and committees
- Provides engagement improvement suggestions, such as maintaining participation or trying new activities

### ⚠️ Early Warning Feature
- Triggered by declining wellness or engagement metrics
- Displays contributing factors in bullet points
- Provides access to academic advisors and counselling support resources
- Designed to encourage early intervention

### 📚 Assignments & Academic Progress
- Weekly overview of completed and pending assignments
- Scrollable daily records for assignment tracking
- Generates brief engagement insights based on academic activity (assignment completion patterns)

📈 Weekly Analysis Report
- Weekly summary of:
  - Wellness score
  - Engagement score
  - Social score
- Colour-coded indicators based on performance thresholds
- Trend analysis visualisations:
  - Stress level trends over time
  - Participation trends across weeks
- Alerts and recommended support actions based on detected patterns

### 🧭 Navigation Bar
- Persistent bottom navigation bar providing access to:
  - Dashboard
  - Analytics
  - Profile (conceptual)

## 💭 Reflection

This project helped me understand that effective solutions are not only about technical correctness, but also about understanding users. Interviewing students from different faculties gave me diverse perspectives and highlighted that student engagement and wellness are multi-dimensional problems.

As a Data Engineering student, this project helped me appreciate how data analytics can be applied meaningfully to human-centered problems, even at an early conceptual stage.
