# 💡 Design Thinking Project  
**Project Theme:** Student Engagement & Wellness Analytics

This project applies the design thinking approach to address issues related to student engagement and wellness in university life. The goal was to explore how data and simple analytics can be used to better understand students’ academic engagement and overall well-being.

## 🎯 Problem Focus

University students often experience challenges related to motivation, stress, workload, and engagement. However, these issues are not always visible or systematically analyzed. Our project focuses on how a student engagement and wellness analytics system could help identify patterns and support better interventions.

## 🧠 Design Thinking Process

### 1️⃣ Empathize  
We conducted interviews with **4 university students**:
- 1 student from the **Faculty of Computing**
- 3 students from the **Faculty of Chemical & Energy Engineering**

Through these interviews, we gathered insights into:
- Academic stress and workload
- Engagement with courses
- Awareness of personal well-being
- Gaps in existing student support systems

---

### 2️⃣ Define  
Based on the interviews, we identified common pain points related to:
- Lack of awareness of personal engagement levels
- Difficulty tracking academic and wellness patterns
- Limited data-driven feedback for students

---

### 3️⃣ Ideate  
We brainstormed features for a system that could:
- Track engagement and wellness indicators
- Provide simple analytics and visual feedback
- Help students reflect on their academic habits

---

### 4️⃣ Prototype (Low-Fidelity)
We created a **low-fidelity prototype** using:
- **Canva** for UI layout design  
- **Hand sketches** to visualize and refine the interface with digital design
- App interface called "UniWell"

The prototype focuses on clarity and usability rather than technical implementation.

### 5️⃣ Testing
We tested our prototype with a university student from the **Faculty of Computing**

From the testing phase, we observed:
- Student reaction towards visualized personal wellness and engagement data
- Clear features (Student Pulse, Attendance Monitoring, Mood Calendar, Early Warning Feature, Assignment Progress Tracking, Weekly Report\0
- Features that need refinement (Clearer UI)

## 💭 Reflection

This project helped me understand that effective solutions are not only about technical correctness, but also about understanding users. Interviewing students from different faculties gave me diverse perspectives and highlighted that student engagement and wellness are multi-dimensional problems.

As a Data Engineering student, this project helped me appreciate how data analytics can be applied meaningfully to human-centered problems, even at an early conceptual stage.

## 🌱 What I Learned
- Applying design thinking in a structured way
- Conducting and analyzing user interviews
- Translating user needs into interface ideas
- Collaborating and communicating ideas clearly

---

## 🔧 Suggested Improvements
- Conduct interviews with a larger and more diverse group
- Develop a higher-fidelity interactive prototype
- Integrate basic data visualization concepts in future iterations
