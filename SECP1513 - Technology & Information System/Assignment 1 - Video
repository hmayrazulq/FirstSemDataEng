## Overview
This assignment is based on our class visit to UTMDigital for our first industrial visit. As a group, we recorded as many
videos for the content and interview as many staff as we could to gain more insights. This was our first assignment together
as a group, and other than finishing the assignment, it was also a good opportunity for me to recognise and get to know my 
classmates, help each other and understanding each other's strengths and weaknesses, supporting one another along the way.
