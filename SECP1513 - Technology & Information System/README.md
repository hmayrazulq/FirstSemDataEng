# 🏭 Industry Talk & Industry Visit
## 📌 Industry Visit 1: UTMDigital

During the visit, me and my sections attended 3 talks about System Development, Project Managing, UTMSmart, data centres, etc. by UTMDigital staff. We gained information beyond the classroom about data engineering at UTM and in the current job trends.

## 📌 Industry Talk 1: PPG

Through this industry talk, I was exposed to how large-scale organizations manage technology, data, and information systems to support decision-making and operations. The session helped me understand the importance of aligning IT systems with business goals and ICT roles.

## 📌 Industry Talk 2: Serunai Commerce

The talk provided a comprehensive overview of Project Management and System Development, its applications across computer science programmes, and the 'FYP' trap. Attending the talk encouraged me to utilize AI tools instead of relying on them, and to build my portfolio and master key skills before it is time to do my FYP Project in Year 4.

## What I gained:

- Better understanding of industry expectations
- Awareness of how information systems support daily operations
- Increased motivation to develop relevant technical and soft skills

# 🖥️ PC Assembly (Lab)
This lab session focused on assembling computer hardware components and understanding their functions.

## Skills gained:
- Identifying and assembling core PC components
- Understanding hardware compatibility
- Appreciating the relationship between hardware and system performance

This activity strengthened my foundational knowledge of computing systems, which is important for my future studies in data engineering.

# 🎤 Pembangunan SECP Talk
The SECP talk highlighted the importance of ethics, joining hackatons or competitions, and maintaining academic success in computer science. It increased my awareness of how technology professionals must consider the overall value of an individual when recruiting future employees or interns.

# 🌏 ASEAN Quantum Summit
The ASEAN Quantum Summit introduced emerging technologies, particularly quantum computing, and their potential future impact. Although still at an early stage, this exposure broadened my perspective on where technology is heading and how it may affect data-driven fields.

# 📖 Chapters 1–8 (Lecture Materials)
All lecture materials for Chapters 1–8 are included in this folder.
Some files may show “error rendering embedded code” on GitHub due to file conversion from PPTX to PDF; however, the files are complete and accessible when downloaded directly.

These chapters covered:
- Fundamentals of information systems
- Types of information systems
- Role of technology in organizations
- Current and emerging technology trends

# 📝 Assignments Summary
I have provided a folder for all my assignments throught the course, including:
- The assignment questions
- My answers and explanations

## 📄 Assignment 1

This group assignment focused on understanding core TIS concepts through UTMDigital Industry Visit. We held interviews and recorded scenery to compile in a video through CapCut which projects the input obtained after the visit. I hope to attend more industry visits especially outside of my own university in the future for more industrial exposure.

## 📄 Assignment 2

This assignment required deeper analysis and application of concepts discussed during the PPG Industry Talk. We created a poster that reflects our understanding. Furthermore, we also gained valuable technical skills like creative designing through Canva elements, creating a good comprehensive poster.

## 📄 Assignment 3

This assignment is an academic writing about the Project Management and System Development (Serunai Commerce) Talk. We emphasized critical thinking, relating theory to real-world technology use. A skill such like academic writing is important and i wish to have more practice on this so that i can improve my professional writing abilities.

Together, these assignments demonstrate my progression in understanding Technology & Information Systems throughout the semester.

# 💡 Design Thinking Project
The design thinking project introduced a structured approach to problem-solving using creativity and user-centered design.
Out topic was about **Student Engagement or Wellness Analytics**, where we created a low-fidelity prototype to monitor student activity and provide real-time solutions when they feel demotivated. A report, video, and prototype (Canva Tools & Sketching) was created to fully demonstrate and document our prototype development.

**Key learning outcomes:**
- Identifying real problems
- Ideation and low-fidelity prototyping
- Collaboration and communication skills

This project helped me understand that technology solutions should be designed with users in mind, not just technical feasibility.

# 🔍 Reflections
## Summary: What I Gained from This Course

Overall, this course helped me understand how technology and information systems support organizations, industries, and society. I gained both technical awareness and soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and critical thinking.

## Suggested Improvements
- More hands-on system-based activities
- Additional real-world case studies
- Longer industry engagement sessions

# 🎓 Personal Reflection

As a Data Engineering student, this course gave me a strong foundation before diving deeper into technical subjects. It helped me see the bigger picture of how data, systems, and technology interact in real environments, which motivates me to continuously improve my skills.
