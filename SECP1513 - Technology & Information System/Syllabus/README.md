## 📘 Reflection

These chapters provided a strong theoretical foundation for the course. They helped me understand how information systems are structured and why they are essential in modern organizations.
The lecture content also supported my understanding during assignments and industry talks and in which would help me build a foundational understanding
for my Final Year Project (FYP) in the future.
